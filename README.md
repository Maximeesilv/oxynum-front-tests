##### Hey you ! 
If you are consulting this file, it's because you met someone from our team ‚ù§Ô∏è and you are ready to take on the challenge to be a new team member. So... How about we get started ?

## Presentation

The purpose in this challenge is to work directly on a little project. So you will start from nothing, with your best IDE, and will put online a beautiful and awesome application. 

You will have to chose **3 topics** between the list below. Chose topics in which you are the most comfortable! The goal is to show your skills in each of the topic you will tackle.

## Topics list

So now you need to choose 3 topics inside this list.

- Styling - CSS3 / SCSS / LESS

- Framework JS - VueJS, ReactJS, Angular... Others ?
- Docker
- Back-end (PHP, Ruby, Python, C#, JAVA, NodeJS ... ?)
- UI/UX
- Databases SQL
- Databases NoSQL
- AWS
- Firebase
- Architecture
- CI / CD
- GIT

## First thing to do - Prepare code delivery

Whether you're on mac, windows, linux... 

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a folder in which you will start to work, and name it **oxynum-project-yourname**. Know that this folder will be send later to the Team to be reviewed in **.zip** file!
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a `skills.txt` file inside this folder and place the topic you chosed:

### Example: *skills.txt*

```
UI/UX
Javascript ES6 + Framework JS VueJS
Firebase
```

- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a **project** folder inside **oxynum-project-yourname**. This is where your code will be.

Now the folder is ready to be delivered once you finish the project üòé

## Get to know the challenge.

You will have to create a tool called **SmartUp**. A smart, small, powerful little application that can handle your incomes ! Some functionnalities are viral for the app, choose the one you want to implement.

### You are free on the design
Don't waste too much time on it, we want something that works in terms of features. We are mostly evaluating the code.
